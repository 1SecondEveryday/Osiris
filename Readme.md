A multipart form encoder for Swift.

# Installation

Copy the file [`MultipartFormEncoder.swift`][code] into your project.

[code]: https://github.com/1SecondEveryday/Osiris/blob/master/MultipartFormEncoder.swift

# Usage

Create an encoder and then add parts to it as needed:

```Swift
let encoder = MultipartFormEncoder()
try! encoder.addText(name: "email", text: "somebody@example.com")
try! encoder.addText(name: "password", text: "secret")
let avatarData = UIImageJPEGRepresentation(avatar, 1)!
encoder.addBinary(name: "avatar.jpg", contentType: "image/jpeg", data: avatarData)
```

You can encode the entire form as `Data` in memory if it's not very big:

```Swift
let encoded = try encoder.encodeToMemory()
var request = URLRequest(url: URL(string: "https://example.com/accounts")!)
request.httpMethod = "POST"
request.httpBody = encoded.body
request.addValue(encoded.contentType, forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")
request.addValue("\(encoded.contentLength)", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Length")
// ... whatever you normally do with requests
```

For larger forms you can also stream the encoded form data directly to disk:

```Swift
let path = NSTemporaryDirectory().appending("/form.data")
let encoded = try encoder.encodeToDisk(path: path)
var request = URLRequest(url: URL(string: "https://example.com/accounts")!)
request.httpMethod = "POST"
request.addValue(encoded.contentType, forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")
request.addValue("\(encoded.contentLength)", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Length")
let task = URLSession.shared.uploadTask(with: request, fromFile: encoded.bodyFileURL) { maybeData, maybeResponse, maybeError in

}
task.resume()

```

You can create and add your own parts using the `MultipartFormEncoder.Part` struct and `MultipartFormEncoder.addPart(_ part: Part)`.
